immediate question: wtf is going on with my put lol, it just selects first ID always,
i mean it works but it doesnt,

Question in addcows somewhere.

Go over flow of put.

I think that the ID sent in the editCow's axios post (inside of App) is the target.
This id is gotten  when you click on the edit button inside of Entry.js
The ID is the first thing sent in the post, second is the new name(?)
so in the model we target the req.params.id  but then im not sure on the second part
are we attatching the new name to req.body and then having to specify the object with
{new: true} to let mongo know that this is an update to the field?
and then the callback is what send all of that back to the client.
